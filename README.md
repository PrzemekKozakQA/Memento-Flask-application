> Note: The application is hosted on the free Render server and needs 3-4 minutes to wake up. After restarting the server, all changes made will be lost

## Knowledge gained

This application is my original project, which is also my final project for the [CS50x course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) at Harvard University. During this course and working on the project, I learned the basics of: Python, the Flask framework, SQL, HTML, CSS and JS. I learned the basics of these technologies, so I am aware that my code is not very sophisticated ðŸ˜‰.  
Even though the application was created as a final project, the idea for it and its implementation was not suggested and is entirely my idea.  

**As part of the development of my software tester skills, I added to the project:**

* [Integration tests in Postman](#integration-tests-in-postman)
* [Continuous Integration with Github Actions](#continuous-integration-ci-with-github-actions)
* [Using GitHub Pages, I added a publication of a report from tests run in CI](#testing-and-test-report-from-ci)

## General Information

Memento is a web application that helps users learn and remember difficult concepts or learn words from foreign languages. After creating an account, the user can add words and their meanings, browse them, search them, and has access to tools supporting memory. These include a quiz and a randomization of previously added content combined with an attempt to recall the meaning. The application is designed to run in web browsers on computers and mobile devices.

## Features

* **Individual accounts**: Users can create individual accounts. Once logged in, they can manage words/concepts specific to their account.

## Installation and running

***To run the application, you can use one of three methods.***

1. Live demo on Render server.  

    The application is hosted on the free Render server at: <https://test-memento.onrender.com>. Due to the limitations of free hosting, the first application launch may take 3-4 minutes. The entered data is also not stored between sessions.
    You can use saved user to explore the features of the Memento app.  
    The details for the test account are:
    > username: Tester  
    > password: tester123

2. Launching the application from the Docker container.  

    The application's Docker image is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/przemekqa/memento_app/general). To run the container with the application, just use the command:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 -d przemekqa/memento_app  
    ```

    If Docker does not find the image file locally, it should automatically initiate its download from DockerHub.  

    The application should be available in your browser at <http://localhost:5000/>

3. Downloading the source code and installing the dependencies.  

    _Note:  
          The installation instructions below will be suitable for Ubuntu 22.04.  
          For Windows I recommend using WSL with Ubuntu 22.04 installed._  

    To launch Memento applications, execute the following commands in the terminal:  

    3.1 Update apt package manager:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

    3.2 Install the necessary packages:

    sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
    ```

    3.3 Download the source code files from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrzemekKozakQA/Memento-memory_helper_web_app.git
    ```

    3.4 Change to the "app" directory in the application code directory:

    ```bash
    cd Memento-memory_helper_web_app/app/
    ```

    3.5 Create a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    3.6 Activate the previously created virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    3.7 Download the necessary libraries:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    3.8 Run the application in debug mode with Flask:  

    ```bash
    flask run -p 5000
    ```

    <p>&emsp;or using the WSGI Gunicorn server with the command:</p>

    ```bash
    gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:5000 app:app
    ```

    The application should be available in your browser at **<http://127.0.0.1:5000/>**

    _Note:
          To stop the application, press **Ctrl+C**. To exit the virtual environment, enter the ```deactivate``` command.  
          If you want to run the application again, just repeat steps 3.4, 3.6 and 3.8 ._

## Database

In the project I used the SQLite database engine. To connect to the database, I used the cs50 library, which uses SQLAlchemy.
There are two tables in the database:

* users - stores user data.  
  Below is the query creating users table:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, 
    username TEXT NOT NULL, 
    hash TEXT NOT NULL, 
    UNIQUE(username)
    );
    ```

* words - stores data with words and their definitions.  
  Below is the query creating words table:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE words (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, 
    word varchar(100) NOT NULL, 
    definition TEXT NOT NULL, 
    userId INTEGER, 
    isMemorized INTEGER DEFAULT 0, 
    FOREIGN KEY(userId) REFERENCES users(id),
    UNIQUE(word, userId)
    );
    ```

## Continuous Integration (CI) with Github Actions

In the project, I used GitHub Actions to run tests, get test reports, publish it and upload a new version of the application image to DockerHub.  
The Docker container with the application is built based on the settings from the [Dockerfile file](./Dockerfile).  

### Testing and test report from CI

Integration tests written in Postman are run using the Newman command line tool. After performing the tests, a report is generated in an .html file.
Test report file can be downloaded from GitHub by going to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/PrzemekKozakQA/Memento-memory_helper_web_app/actions), details of a specific run in the Artifacts section.  

<p align="center">
    <img src="gif_files\report.gif" alt="GIF showing where to find the test report file" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 800px;">
</p>

After each change merged to main, a report is also created and automatically published via GitHub Pages.  
**The latest report available at:**  
<https://przemekkozakqa.github.io/Memento-memory_helper_web_app/test-report.html>

Sample report view:

### CI for development branches

![GitHub Action main branch status](https://github.com/PrzemekKozakQA/Memento-memory_helper_web_app/actions/workflows/test_and_push_to_DockerHub.yml/badge.svg)  

After pushing the changes to development branches (all branches except main), CI is launched with the configuration from the [test_changes.yml](/.github/workflows/test_changes.yml) file. First, a container with the application is built, then tests are run and a test report is generated. The report file is named test_report_from_branch_{branch name}. The report file is available for download in workflow run details.

### CI for main branch

![GitHub Action main branch status](https://github.com/PrzemekKozakQA/Memento-memory_helper_web_app/actions/workflows/test_changes.yml/badge.svg)  

When changes are merged to the main branch, CI is launched with the configuration from the [test_and_push_to_DockerHub.yml](.github/workflows/test_and_push_to_DockerHub.yml) file. In addition to performing tests, this configuration includes instructions for releasing a version on DockerHub and publishing the test report on Github Pages.

## Testing

### Integration tests in Postman

The frontend of the application uses the JQuery library to send requests to the backend. Data from responses to these requests are necessary to dynamically change some of the displayed content. To check this mechanism, I wrote integration tests in Postman.
Files containing the test code and the file with environment variables are located in the [Postman_tests director](/Postman_tests/).

Scope of tested functionalities:

* Providing information whether the username is already used or not when registering a new user.
* Providing JSON with data when searching by the name of the saved word
* Marking a word in the database as remembered
* Deleting a word from the database
* Providing information that the word ID was not found

**Running tests in the local environment:**  
    To run the tests, download the files from the Postman_Tests folder and then import [the collection file](/Postman_tests/Memento_application_integration_tests.postman_collection.json) and t[he environment file](/Postman_tests/Test_ENV.postman_environment.json) to Postman.  
    The exact import process is described in the [Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/#import-postman-data).  
> After importing the data, remember to select an environment and run the Memento application locally before running the tests.
